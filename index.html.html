    <p>This project is based on a Deep Learning model that analyzed around 70,000 news articles, it is not a factchecker, rather it detects whether the news article is fake or not based on how they are written, i.e if they have a professional writing tone, almost all whatsapp forwards will be detected as fake.</p>
